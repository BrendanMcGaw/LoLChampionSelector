# LoLChampionSelector
A script that accesses the Lol Client API to find the character you've locked in at the character select screen in league of legends and opens the OP.GG/Champion/name for optimal builds.

Waits 10 minutes after opening the browser once, resets the variables requires and starts scanning again for activity. Endless loop on a 2 second delay until information is provided again. Rinse and repeat.
